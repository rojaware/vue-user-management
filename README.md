# VueJS User Management Admin Example

First VueJS application for User management admin page. My first concern is to build front end component with VueJS in order to integrated with Server Side Java application

As existing web application is running on tomcat, I need to find a way to use VueJS to replace existing JQuery and AngularJS codes.

Currently, this application provides:

* CRUD function for user
* Search filter by text input


### Install:
* Clone the repo into your local directory
* Open Window Explorer and click 'list.html'

So simple...
